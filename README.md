Learning Python ... Ongoing ...

# INTRO #
why do we need computer ? speed , calculation etc, human interact with the computer using a program 
whats a program ? a set of instruction you give to the computer to solve a problem.
e.g. a=10, b=20, c=a+b then print(c) 

# Operators # 
1. assignment: means giving something , a task e.g We store a value in a variable using the assignment operator (=).
2. mathematical operators: +, -, x etc.
   variable = assigning a value 

# Data Types #

1. numeric data => data which can be used in amthematical calculation
   numeric data is further divided into two (integer & float) 
   integer: without decimal point e.g 40, 0 to 9 digits, - or + sign 
   float: with decimal e.g 27.3, can contain + or - sign or decimal point, can be between 1.0 & 9 digits 
       
2. non numerical => cant be used for mathematical calculation
   string = non numeric value
   e.g 

# relational operators #
conditions that are true or false

# looping #
execute the same intructions repeatedly
